1. What’s the difference between a “consultation” and a “case” in the packages?
A consultation: A short legal session (20 minutes) to answer your questions and provide general guidance.
A case: Full legal representation in a specific case before the relevant authorities, including preparation, filing, and court appearances (based on the package).
2. What types of cases are currently included in the packages?
Currently, the packages include only personal status cases (e.g. divorce, alimony, custody) and labor disputes (e.g. contract termination, unpaid wages, wrongful dismissal).
Coverage will expand gradually to include other case types.
3. Can I use my consultations for any legal topic?
Yes, consultations can be used for any legal matter you wish to discuss — even if it’s not covered under the case types.
However, court representation is currently limited to personal status and labor cases only.
4. Can I choose the lawyer who handles my case?
No, services are delivered by a specialized legal team from a licensed firm. Cases are assigned based on type and lawyer expertise to ensure quality and confidentiality.
5. Do packages support English or other languages?
Yes, the platform supports several languages including Arabic, English, Urdu, Tagalog, and more to come as we expand.
6. How is my data kept private and secure?
All your data and communications are encrypted and securely managed by a licensed legal system — with no intermediaries — under strict privacy policies.
7. Can I pay for the package in installments?
Yes, flexible payment options are available, including full online payment or installments per the platform’s payment policy.
8. How is consultation time calculated? Can I extend it?
Each consultation is 20 minutes (written, video, or in-person).
It cannot be extended, but you may use another from your package balance if needed.
9. Can I upgrade my package later?
Yes, you can upgrade to a higher package — only if no services (consultation or case) have been used.
Once any service is utilized, the package is fully activated and upgrade is only possible upon renewal.
10. Can I cancel my package and get a refund?
Yes, you may cancel within 7 days of purchase and get a full refund — only if no services have been used.
Once a consultation is consumed or a case is opened, the package becomes non-refundable.
11. Does the package include actual court appearances by a lawyer?
Yes, if the package includes case representation (e.g., gold or silver plans), a licensed lawyer will attend court or authorized body on your behalf — for covered case types (personal status or labor only).
12. Can I use the package for family members?
No, packages are assigned to the subscriber only and cannot be used by others.
Family packages covering multiple individuals will be launched soon.

Any further procedures may require a new agreement or dedicated package.

You may request consultations in your preferred language, and a qualified advisor will assist you.
21. Do I need a National ID or Residency Number to use the platform?

22. Will having a case affect my residency status?
No, having a legal case or seeking advice does not affect your legal residency status — as long as no crimes or violations are committed.
The law protects your rights as a resident and grants you the right to defend yourself and file claims.
23. Can I submit complaints or claims through you?

27. Are you a government entity?
No. We are a licensed digital platform providing legal services through an accredited law firm.
We adhere to the highest legal and professional standards.
28. How is your platform different from other legal apps?

•	Installments via Tabby or Tamara
We ensure secure and convenient payment options.

36. Can I consult with the same lawyer each time?
We try to assign the same lawyer or legal team for ongoing cases whenever possible.
However, case distribution may vary to ensure specialization and timely service.
