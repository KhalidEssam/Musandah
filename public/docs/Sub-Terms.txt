Subscription Terms and Conditions of the "Legal Support Center" Platform
Introduction
These terms represent a part of the contractual relationship between the user and the "Legal Support" platform and become binding once the user subscribes to or activates any legal package on the platform.
By subscribing to a package, the user acknowledges that they have read and agreed to these terms and conditions without reservation.
________________________________________
Packages and Subscription Limits
•	All packages are valid for one Gregorian calendar year from the date of activation.
•	Each package includes a specific number of consultations and cases, as shown in the coverage table upon subscription.
•	The package may not be transferred to another user or assigned for any reason.
•	Coverage currently includes only labor and personal status cases.
________________________________________
Package Usage
•	The package is for personal use only and may not be used on behalf of others or for group representation.
•	A consultation is deducted from the package balance once an appointment is booked, whether attended or missed without prior notice.
•	Each consultation is 20 minutes long, whether written, visual, audio, or in-person.
•	Consultation time cannot be split or carried over.
________________________________________
Service Delivery Priority
If a service request is submitted by a user and it is found that a prior request exists for the same legal incident from another party (whether an opponent or related entity), the service will be provided to the party who submitted the first request. The subsequent request will be rejected to ensure neutrality and avoid conflicts of interest.
________________________________________
Cancellation and Upgrade
•	Users may upgrade to a higher package provided that none of the original package services have been used.
•	Subscription may be canceled and fully refunded within 7 days of activation, provided no services have been utilized.
•	No cancellations are allowed once any portion of the package has been used, even partially.
________________________________________
User Responsibilities
•	Provide accurate and complete data during registration and disclose any ongoing legal cases or prior rulings in matters that may prohibit legal representation.
•	Attend scheduled sessions seriously and make full use of the appointments.
•	Cooperate fully with the legal team and provide required documents and information within the specified time frame.
________________________________________
Limitations of Liability
•	The "Legal Support" platform provides services in cooperation with a licensed legal partner and makes every effort to offer accurate and professional consultations based on the available information.
•	The platform is not legally or judicially responsible for any misunderstanding or misapplication of the consultation by the user without consulting the competent authority.
•	The consultation provided via the platform is not a definitive or binding opinion in court, but rather an initial legal guideline requiring formal procedures.
•	The platform or the legal partner is not liable for any legal, administrative, or financial consequences arising from the user's failure to provide accurate information or complete required documents on time.
________________________________________
Expiration of Coverage
•	The package validity automatically ends after one calendar year from the activation date, without prior notice.
•	Unused services cannot be carried over to the following year, in whole or in part.
•	The package is also considered expired if all services (consultations and cases) have been used, even if the time period has not ended.
•	Unused services are not exchangeable for money or other services.
________________________________________
Final Provisions
•	The "Legal Support" platform reserves the right to modify or update the subscription terms and conditions at any time without prior notice, with the updated version published on the website.
•	Continued use of the package after modifications is considered implicit acceptance of the new terms.
•	In the event of any conflict between the text of this document and any promotional or awareness content, the terms and conditions stated here shall prevail as the primary reference.
•	This subscription is governed by the applicable laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the courts of Riyadh shall have jurisdiction over any arising disputes.
